Description: CluMSID is a tool that aids the identification of features 
    in untargeted LC-MS/MS analysis by the use of MS2 spectra similarity 
    and unsupervised statistical methods. It offers functions for a complete 
    and customisable workflow from raw data to visualisations and is
    interfaceable with the xmcs family of preprocessing packages.
